Okay so we can talk here and write whatever

Anyway Ive added all of what you can see
On top of that each map piece has a Marker in the middle so maybe we can use these to move the player - 
 - instead of via rigidbody which can be unpredictable and not move to exactly where we want to a more decided location
ALSO we can make the movement not instant and lerp between the positions so its more understandable to the eye and players
ALSO ALSO the camera snapping is a little to snappy for me, I cant understand when you turn and from where and when - 
- but I dont know how to change it because it uses some RigidBody method that I dont know so I cant really use it but - 
- if we can animate the rotation so it's smooth and visible it will be much better

Other than that I've added a buncha stuff 
Thanks for listening to my TED talk
